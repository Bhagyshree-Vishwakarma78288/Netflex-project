# Netflex-project
 "I developed the Netflex project using Python to analyze and visualize streaming data. By leveraging libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, the project aims to uncover content trends and user preferences, thereby enhancing data-driven decision-making and strategic insights."
